    <div class="zippy-header faq-question">What is Psychotherapy?</div>
    <div class="zippy-content"><p>Psychotherapy is a process of working with a trained mental health professional to address emotional, psychological, and behavioral issues. It typically involves meeting with a therapist on a regular basis, either in person or online, to explore and understand the root causes of these issues and develop strategies to manage them more effectively. Therapy can be helpful for a wide range of concerns, including anxiety, depression, relationship issues, trauma, and more. The goal of therapy is to improve overall mental health and wellbeing, and help individuals live more fulfilling and satisfying lives.

    <div class="zippy-header faq-question">What are the benefits of therapy?</div>
    <div class="zippy-content"><p>Therapy can offer a range of benefits, from improving your mental health and wellbeing to helping you overcome specific challenges or issues. By working with a therapist, you can gain insight into your thoughts and behaviors, develop coping strategies, and build resilience to help you navigate life's ups and downs. Therapy can also provide a safe and nonjudgmental space to explore difficult emotions, process trauma, and work through relationship or family issues. Ultimately, therapy can help you gain a better understanding of yourself and your goals, and provide you with the tools and support you need to lead a more fulfilling and satisfying life.</p></div>
    <div class="zippy-header faq-question">What will therapy cost?</div>
    <div class="zippy-content"><p>Therapy Fees are $240 per 50 minute session. Full payment is due at the time services are rendered.</p>
    <p>As of January 1, 2022, state-licensed or certified health care providers are required to give a Good Faith Estimate of healthcare charges to every new and continuing client who does not have health insurance or does not plan to submit a claim to their insurance.</p>
    <p>This estimate is designed to provide you with predictability in how much you will be charged for the mental health services you will be receiving, prior to your appointment.</p>
    <p>You can ask your healthcare provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule a service. I am happy to provide any information that helps with understanding and anticipating any costs associated with working with me.</p>
    <p>For questions or more information about your right to a Good Faith Estimate, visit www.cms.gov/nosurprises or call (800) 985-3059.</p></div>
    <div class="zippy-header faq-question">Do you work with insurance?</div>
    <div class="zippy-content"><p>As an "out of network" provider, I am not directly affiliated with any insurance companies. However, I am able to provide you with a statement you can submit to your insurance company for potential reimbursement of therapy expenses. This statement, sometimes called a superbill or invoice, includes all the necessary information about the therapy session, such as the date, length, and cost of the session, as well as my credentials as a mental health professional. While the amount of reimbursement will depend on the specific insurance plan, many plans will cover a portion of out of network therapy costs. If you have any questions about reimbursement or the superbill, please don't hesitate to ask as I am here to support you.</p></div>
    <div class="zippy-header faq-question">Is therapy confidential?</div>
    <div class="zippy-content"><p>Confidentiality is crucial in therapy because it helps establish a safe and secure environment for you to explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without worrying about judgment or consequences. As a therapist, I am bound by both state and federal laws, including HIPAA, to protect your privacy and keep all information discussed in therapy confidential. This means that I cannot share any information about your treatment with anyone else without your explicit consent, except in certain circumstances such as if there is a risk of harm to yourself or others.</p> 
    <p>As part of your intake process, you will receive a Consent for Treatment Form and a HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices to review before your first session. These documents provide detailed information about the therapeutic process, confidentiality, and your rights as a client. We will also discuss the limits of confidentiality during our first visit to ensure that you have a clear understanding of when and how confidentiality may be breached.</p></div>
    <div class="zippy-header faq-question">How do I know who is the right therapist for me?</div>
    <div class="zippy-content"><p>Choosing the right therapist can be a daunting task, but there are a few things to keep in mind to help you find the right fit. Start by looking for therapists who specialize in the type of issue you want to address, and check their credentials to ensure they are licensed and trained in their field. It's also important to consider their therapeutic approach and philosophy to see if it aligns with your own goals and values. When you begin your search, it's a good idea to schedule consultations with a few different therapists to see who you feel most comfortable with and who you can see yourself building a strong therapeutic relationship with. Remember that therapy is a collaborative process, and finding the right therapist is about finding someone who you feel comfortable opening up to and who can provide the support and guidance you need to achieve your goals.</p></div>
