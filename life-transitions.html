            <p>You've experienced a significant change in your life.</p>
            <p>Whether you have recently relocated to a new place, welcomed a new baby to the family or decided to get a divorce. Or maybe you are considering a new job or grieving the loss of a loved one.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the challenge, you're grappling with a flood of overwhelming emotions. You're feeling drained, stressed and anxious. You had hoped for a smoother journey, but it hasn't turned out this way.</p>
            <p>There's a sense of disconnection and you're uncertain about how to process this heavy emotional load. You grieve the life you once knew but has now changed.</p>
            <p>You want to feel more connected to yourself and find inner peace. You want to rediscover your sense of purpose in your new life.</p>
            <p>You deserve to feel heard, supported and validated during these challenging times.</p>

        <h1>I am here to Help</h1>
        <p>In our work together, you are my top priority.</p>
        <p>During our sessions, I am actively engaged, offering warmth, compassion and a direct, loving approach. I might occasionally use humor to help us navigate the often ironic ways life throws us curveballs. You can rely on me to consistently show up as my authentic self each time we meet.</p>
        <p>In therapy, we'll tackle the challenges that come with major life changes, including shifts in identity often that often arise, the grief and loss of what once was and the complex emotions that you may be experiencing. We will also explore any unresolved trauma that may impact your ability to cope during these transitions, along with changes in family dynamics and the stress and anxiety they can bring.</p>
        <p>I can help you create a roadmap to navigate these life changes and move forward with hope and resilience.</p>
