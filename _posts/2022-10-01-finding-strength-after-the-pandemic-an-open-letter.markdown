Do you ever feel like you're just barely keeping your head above water these days? Like you're struggling to keep up with everything and it feels like you're just treading water?

I get it!

The past couple of years, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, have been incredibly challenging for so many of us. Even though things may be starting to return to some semblance of normalcy, the truth is that many of us are still feeling the impact of everything we've been through.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global crisis of unprecedented scale, disrupting every aspect of our lives in ways we never could have imagined. The effects of the pandemic have been far-reaching- From our work to our social lives, from our physical health to our mental well-being, the pandemic has left its mark on us in ways we are still uncovering. 

I'd like to take a moment to reach out and remind you that recovery is not just about adjusting to a new normal and keeping up with the fast-paced life that is often forced upon us. It's about coming to terms with what we've been through and giving ourselves the time and space to grieve the loss we experienced; The loss of loved ones, the loss of precious time, experiences and opportunities, and the loss of relationships.

Be mindful that recovery looks different for everyone. Some of us may need to take more time to rest and recharge, while others may find solace in connecting with loved ones or pursuing new hobbies and interests. 

I would like to encourage you to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this complex journey. Allow yourself to take a step back and acknowledge the toll that the pandemic has taken on you. Give yourself permission to slow down, prioritize your own well-being and take things at your own pace.

As we continue to navigate the aftermath of the pandemic, it's important to remember that recovery is not a linear process. There will be ups and downs, and setbacks are a natural part of the journey. But by being kind to ourselves, practicing resilience, and seeking support when we need it, we can move forward and start to rebuild our lives in a way that feels authentic and meaningful.
