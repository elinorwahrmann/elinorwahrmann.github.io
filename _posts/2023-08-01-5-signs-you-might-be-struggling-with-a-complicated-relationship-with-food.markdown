Do you ever find your thoughts consumed by food? Do you catch yourself overanalyzing your meals, wrestling with guilt over certain foods, or turning to food when emotions run high?
When food becomes the center of your life, overtaking your thoughts and time, it can become an overwhelming presence in your daily life. Many people grapple with complex relationships with food, often influenced by the pervasive messages on social media. These platforms can bombard us with unrealistic beauty standards, perpetuating the pressure to attain a picture-perfect image that can be mentally taxing.
Struggling with food can be incredibly tough, especially when it feels like it's taking control of your life, and you're weighed down by shame. This experience can be isolating because the shame often pushes you to hide these thoughts and behaviors. You might start avoiding social gatherings or connecting with friends out of fear that your secret will be exposed. This distance can pile on more stress and shame and take a toll on your mental health.  
It's no wonder you might feel like you're the only one going through this. The shame and guilt can make you believe that no one could possibly understand, so it's best to keep it all to yourself. The problem is that the more you keep it a secret, the more discouraged and ashamed you'll feel. 
The reality is, there are millions of people in this world who struggle with disordered eating. Some might even be closer than you think—friends, family, or colleagues. But how do you know when it's become a real problem? When does it go beyond the ordinary and it’s time to seek help? 
Here are 5 common signs and behaviors for you to consider, that may indicate that your relationship with food is unhealthy:
1. Obsessive thoughts about food: Do you find yourself constantly thinking about food, planning your meals obsessively, or feeling guilty or anxious when you eat? You might also find that thoughts about food consume a lot of your time and energy, leaving you feeling overwhelmed and exhausted.
2. Emotional eating: Do you use food as a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or other emotions? Do you eat even when you're not hungry, just because it makes you feel better? You might also find that you often turn to certain types of food during certain emotions, such as sugary snacks when you're feeling down.
3. Binge eating or restrictive eating: Do you often eat large amounts of food in a short period of time (binge eating), or restrict your food intake to the point of hunger (restrictive eating)? You might also find that you have difficulty controlling how much you eat or that you have a lot of rules around what you can and can't eat.
4. Feeling out of control around food: Do you find it difficult to stop eating once you have started, or feel like you have no control over your food choices? You might also find that you eat even when you're not hungry, just because the food is there, and you can't resist it.
5. Shame or guilt about eating: Do you feel ashamed or guilty after eating, or feel like you need to punish yourself for eating certain foods? You might also find that you avoid certain foods altogether because they make you feel guilty, and you worry about what others might think of you if they see you eat them.

Having a complicated relationship with food can take a toll on both your physical and mental health. It can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, anxiety, and even depression. This is why it's important to be aware of the signs and behaviors that may indicate an unhealthy relationship with food.
While there are strategies that can help improve your relationship with food, it's important to recognize that it's not always easy to overcome these challenges on your own. Seeking help from a therapist can provide you with the tools and support you need to regain a sense of control over your relationship with food.
Remember, there's no shame in seeking help. Shame thrives in secrecy, but by speaking up and seeking help, you can begin to heal and learn to enjoy food in a healthy and balanced way.
