Over the years, societal expectations have undergone a profound transformation. 

Women were once confined to more traditional and narrowly defined roles, bound by societal norms dictating their place in the household and community. Nowadays, women face the pressure to navigate a complex landscape where the traditional expectations haven't vanished; they've expanded. Many women were raised with traditional gender roles while simultaneously encouraged and empowered to break through professional barriers and pursue successful careers. However, despite achieving remarkable success in their careers, they continue to take on most of the household duties. 

The expectation to seamlessly juggle careers, family, relationships, and personal ambitions can be overwhelming. This ongoing load leaves many women feeling utterly exhausted and drained. It’s important to recognize that these expectations, old and new, are simply unrealistic and ultimately unsustainable.

It’s time we acknowledge that society places immense and often unattainable demands on women. We're incessantly bombarded with portrayals of idealized perfection and success, convincing us that effortlessly excelling in every aspect of life is not only possible but expected.

The weight you carry on your shoulders, the exhaustion that seeps into your bones, and the sense of being trapped by societal expectations; It's a heavy burden that countless women bear silently, concealing their emotions out of shame and the fear of judgment. 

But I want you to know that you are not alone. 

We all experience these overwhelming emotions, yet few find the courage to openly share their truth.

I want to take a moment to acknowledge and honor your struggle. 

I invite you to pause and take a breath.  

Remind yourself that what you’re doing is HARD!
You are doing the best you can.
You are enough. 

Think about all those difficult moments you've conquered and the challenges you've faced. Acknowledge your wins- both big and small. 

Remember, it's okay to give yourself a break and to be kind to yourself along this challenging path. It's not an easy road, and feeling overwhelmed, exhausted and sad is perfectly normal. 

You deserve love, support, and compassion— especially from yourself.

Allow yourself the space to prioritize self-care, and to accept help and support from those who encourage you and make you feel valued and loved. 

I hope you give yourself permission to celebrate your imperfections and acknowledge the extraordinary strength it takes to navigate the complexities of life.

With love, 

Elinor
